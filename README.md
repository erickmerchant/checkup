# checkup

Essentially it looks at all the directories in the current working directory and runs [david](https://www.npmjs.com/package/david) on them. I wrote this because [this page](https://david-dm.org/erickmerchant) wasn't working. It also runs git status. More tests may be added in the future.

## Install

Install it globally.

```
npm install -g @erickmerchant/checkup
```

## Run

Get help by running.

```
checkup --help
```
